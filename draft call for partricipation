HPC facilities face the challenge of serving a diverse user base with different skill levels and needs. Some users run precompiled applications, while others develop complex, highly optimized codes. On the other hand we observe mathematics led innovation both in EU and USA, with critical demand of Computational Science Research Methods to bridge the HPC talent gap. 

Therefore, HPC training must include a variety of topics at different levels to cater to a range of skillsets. As centers worldwide install increasingly heterogeneous architectures, training will be even more important and in greater demand. A good training program can have many benefits: less time spent on rudimentary assistance, efficient utilization of resources, increased staff-user interaction, and training of the next generation of users. 

In this workshop we aim to expose best practices for delivering HPC training and develop collaborative connections between participating HPC centers worldwide.

We solicit contributions of short, ten-minute talks on these topics of interest:
•	Measurement of training outcomes
•	Methods of attracting users to training
•	Collaborations between HPC facilities for training
•	Balancing lecture and hands-on activities
•	Accessibility of training
•	Accommodation of learning styles in training
•	Enabling collaborations between scientists
•	On-line training
•	Introducing new architectures and programming paradigms

It's good to put a statement for publishing as well as the ACM SIGS proceeding are automatically set up for the conference:

Submission Guidelines:

Authors are invited to submit manuscripts in English structured as technical papers not exceeding 8 letter size (8.5x11) pages including figures, tables, and references using the ACM SIGS format for conference proceedings. Submissions not conforming to these guidelines may be returned without review. Reference style files are available at http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates#aL1.

Full papers will be published with the SC'14 workshop proceedings in the ACM digital library. Selected papers will be invited for an extended version in a special issue of … Journal.

All manuscripts will be reviewed and judged on correctness, originality, technical strength, and significance, quality of presentation, and interest and relevance to the workshop attendees. Submitted papers must represent original unpublished research that is not currently under review for any other conference or journal. Papers not following these guidelines will be rejected without review and further action may be taken, including (but not limited to) notifications sent to the heads of the institutions of the authors and sponsors of the conference. Submissions received after the due date, exceeding length limit, or not appropriately structured may also not be considered. At least one author of an accepted paper must register for and attend the workshop. Authors may contact the workshop program chair for more information.
